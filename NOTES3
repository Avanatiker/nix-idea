Implementation issues:
  Custom index for references?
  Why NavigatableSymbol? Couldn't you just use the usage search? Why do I have to implement the declaration search twice?
  !Should I implement PsiSymbolReferenceSearcher?
  !What is SearchService.searchPsiSymbolReferences and SearchService.searchPsiSymbolDeclarations for? They seem unused.
Usage problems
  Why am I not able to jump to the declarations from the usage search?
  Option to make it possible to see declarations in usage-search?
Bad testability
  Documentation only mentions solutions which don't work with symbols
    https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/find-usages-test.html
  myFixture.testFindUsagesUsingAction() fails if there is only one usage, or no usage at all
  myFixture.testFindUsagesUsingAction() does not return declarations, which means the declaration search is not tested

NixStringLiteralEscaper.unescapeAndDecode does not work with empty lines
NixStringLiteralEscaper.unescapeAndDecode does not detect right indentation for blank lines
